# Hello there! 
### Welcome to the WIP Notion Progress Dashboard 

This is my first API project, and I have absolutely fallen in love with Notion in the past year. It has completely revolutionized my productivity.   

I've always wanted there to be some way I can track my progress to completing my goals, and I revamped my to do list for this, but was still missing an important part of the motivation process: progress bars and charts!!  

### First API, big step in motivation 

There's a lot to do here still, and a lot of features I want to add. I've learned a ton about working with APIs so far and can't wait to learn more. 
 ## To Do List 
 
- [ ] make it a website!
- [x] add progress bar 
- [x] get rid of undefined error with undefined dates
- [x] better legend alignment on pie charts
- [x] compatibility with epic progress
- [ ] other people accessible :) @Ben Potter will help
- [ ] how to link to a notion template?
- [x] clean the code abomination
- [x] animated progress bar
- [ ] choose order and objects to show
- [ ] choose color for each bar (bc colors are cool)

## Things to remember 
 
https://docs.anychart.com/Gantt_Chart/Project_Chart 
- can we incorperate this in the Notion timeline?

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/progress/ 
- for the progress bar? Look other options 

idea: what if there was a way to have a single/few charts/graphs as an individual webpage so you could embed it in a notion page? like copy link to a specific chart
