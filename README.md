# Hello there! 
### Welcome to the WIP Notion Progress Dashboard 

This is my first API project, and I have absolutely fallen in love with Notion in the past year. It has completely revolutionized my productivity.   

I've always wanted there to be some way I can track my progress to completing my goals, and I revamped my to do list for this, but was still missing an important part of the motivation process: progress bars and charts!!  

### First API, big step in motivation 

There's a lot to do here still, and a lot of features I want to add. I've learned a ton about working with APIs so far and can't wait to learn more. 
 ## To Do List 
 
- [ ] make it an accessible website!
- [ ] add progress bar + pie chart toggle
- [ ] get rid of undefined error with undefined dates
- [ ] better legend alignment on pie charts
- [ ] compatibility with epic progress
- [ ] other people accessible w/o code :) @Ben Potter will help
- [ ] how to link to a notion template?

## Things to remember

- can we incorperate this in the Notion timeline?

- for the progress bar? Look other options
